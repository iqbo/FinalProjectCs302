player interpret path method. 

//Follows backedges from a given node to the central point
//Interprets the backedge to a player move and adds it to the stack
//
Player::interpath(node * last){
	node * n = last;
	double move = 0;		//change in angular position of player 
	while(n != NULL){		//follow all backedges
		//Apply logic to determine move
		
		//Calculate change in angular position that represents this move
		
		//Add the move to the stack
		
		//Follow n's backedge
	}
